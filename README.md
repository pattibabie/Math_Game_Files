# Math_Game_Files
This repository contains some of my contributions to a math game project called "Math Quest!" in my Software Engineering class in 2014. I mainly worked on the the back-end game logic, which is included in the MathGame.cs file, and I put all of the story images together with MS Paint, which are in the Math_Quest_Images file.
